                        When she was only 24 years old and single, Sen adopted a baby girl and made her the centre of her life.

                        Ten years later, she adopted another girl. Renee and Alisah are growing up to be confident and strong-minded girls, just like their beautiful mother. </li><br>

                    <li>
                        About her decision to adopt, Sen has said in an earlier interview that while many considered it to be an act of charity, for her, it was self-conservation. The single mother believes her children were born from her heart and that is possibly the purest relationship there can be.
